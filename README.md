# Environmental Cleanliness and Public Health in Indonesia

## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between environmental cleanliness and public health in Indonesia. Given the profound impact of these factors on human welfare, the research focuses on identifying key variables that influence these two aspects and understanding their interconnections. The analysis leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess how environmental factors influence public health outcomes.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between environmental cleanliness (as measured by variables like smoking percentage, sanitation quality, and access to clean water) and public health (as represented by life expectancy, healthcare personnel availability, outpatient treatment rates, health complaints, and stunting cases). The study aims to quantify the impact of environmental factors on public health in Indonesia.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **Central Statistics Agency (BPS)** and covers the period from 2022 to 2023. The data includes variables related to both environmental cleanliness and public health across various regions in Indonesia.

### Environmental Cleanliness Variables:
1. Percentage of Smokers
2. Sanitation Quality
3. Access to Clean Drinking Water

### Public Health Variables:
1. Life Expectancy
2. Number of Medical Personnel
3. Outpatient Treatment Rates
4. Health Complaints
5. Cases of Stunting

## Methodology
The core analytical technique used in this study is **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**. CCA is a multivariate statistical method that identifies relationships between two sets of variables, in this case, environmental cleanliness and public health variables.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and checking for issues such as multicollinearity.
2. **Model Implementation**: Applying CCA to assess the strength and nature of the relationship between environmental and public health variables.
3. **Diagnostic Tests**: Ensuring model assumptions, including normality, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity, are met or addressed.

## Results
The findings of this study reveal the following:
- Sanitation quality and access to clean drinking water significantly and positively affect life expectancy and the number of medical personnel.
- However, issues such as multicollinearity, normality, and homoscedasticity in the dataset suggest the need for further refinement and adjustment of the model.

## Challenges
Several data-related issues were encountered during the analysis, including:
- Normality violations: Some variables did not meet the assumption of normal distribution.
- Homoscedasticity problems: The variance of errors was not constant across all levels of the predictors.
- Multicollinearity: Some predictor variables were highly correlated, which can inflate variance estimates and weaken the model's reliability.

## Conclusion
This research highlights the significant positive impact of environmental cleanliness on public health in Indonesia. However, further refinement of the model is necessary to ensure that all assumptions are met, and the analysis results are reliable. Addressing the identified challenges will lead to more accurate insights and potentially more impactful policy recommendations.
